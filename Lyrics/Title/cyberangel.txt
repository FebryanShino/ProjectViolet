Cyberangel
Song by HOYO-MiX feat. Hanser


Corrupt binary codes infecting my mind
Perform invocation with numbing freeze
Querying for a variable and seizing the time
To recompile and trigger my destiny

Though my wings've been bloodstained and could never rid
I will try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed
There’s no "exception" in this library
For I know I will always go with you

Superhot projectiles pierce the wind
I charged up my armor into lightspeed
Querying for a variable and seizing the time
In a new day coming not so far away

Though my wings've been bloodstained and could never rid
I will try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed
There's no "exception" in this library
For I know I will always go with you

Though my wings’ve been bloodstained and could never rid
I will try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed
There's still no "exception" in this library
For I know I will always go with you

Though my wings've been bloodstained and could never rid
I will try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed
There's no "exception" in this library
For I know I will always go with my heart
