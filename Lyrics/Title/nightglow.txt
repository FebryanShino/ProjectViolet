Nightglow
Song by Tanya Chua


The way I go through with red roses burn my eyes
Cold rain starts pouring hard, I'm being called upon
Never let you go, it's why I did them all
For a chance at least, to live in your way
Love of you is my most cherished thing
So stay alive, bravely
Ahhh
Ahhh
I wish I could wake from the dream each time I dream
There's a long night coming soon, I'd shine as the last shine

Never let you go, it's why I did them all
For a chance at least, to live in your way
Love of you is my most cherished thing
So stay alive, bravely

Never let you go, It's why I did them all
For a chance at least, to live in your way
Love of you is my most cherished thing
So stay alive, bravely
