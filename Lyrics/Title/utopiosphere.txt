Utopiosphere
Song by Mili


Step through the gate into Utopia
Sink into a world of Melodia

Black lace euphoberia hurries away (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Tiny legs leave behind a track of cardioid (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Twisted creation
Phosphorescent apparition
Heart disorientation
Bemusement

Merry go 'round and around
Misery go 'round and around
Quandary go 'round and around
Merry go 'round and around

Tick-tock time doesn't stop
Prepare your doubts eat them up
Quaff down the pus of thoughts
Red sand flows out sweet mouth

The sky is painted in Lunacia
Florets slashed open the vein of tears
Misfortuna
There is no escape, my dear

The world undergoes Photosynthesia
Transform endless anger to Ecstasia
Connect your nerves
