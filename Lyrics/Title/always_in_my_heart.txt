Always in my heart
Song by 山田タマル
Color: #CBB0A0

The way if it's all predetermined
And the way i should go all my life
I swear to go wherever will be
'Cause there'll be something to see and to find

I dont know the meaning of life
But i know what's truly precious
The way it's leading me to be in love
No fear i can find me always in my heart

The life it's not for comparing things
So i hold both of light and shadow
The rays of stars will bring me to you
Throught the dark night skies
See the way to be shined

I dont know what's right for our lives
But i know the truth of my love
The way it feels our breaths at the wind
And the way i should go all my life
I swear to go wherever will be
Thus the grace i wouldn't have
Will always in my heart
Thus the grace i wouldn't have
Will always in my heart
