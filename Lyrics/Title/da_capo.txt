Da Capo
Song by HOYO-MiX


When good old friends are going away
Will you wish them to remember your name?
When good old days are passing away
Will you promise your heart remains the same?

Never can we suspend the time
Having to leave the tracks behind
There is a longer way ahead, After all

There used to be a story teller
Who always painted the sunshine and the rain
One has to eventually grow up
Spending a lifetime to taste love and pain

Never can we suspend the time
Having to leave the tracks behind
There is a longer way ahead, After all

If it's too hard to say goodbye
Give us a try to sing a rhyme
"May you, the beauty of this world, always shine"
